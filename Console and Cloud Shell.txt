Console and Cloud Shell
=========================

===========================================
Task 1: Create a bucket using Cloud Shell
===========================================

Step 1. Create a bucket with a globally unique name 

gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>


=========================================================================
Task 2: Uploaded a file to the Cloud Shell VM and copied it to a bucket
=========================================================================

Step 1. In Cloud Shell, type ls to confirm that a file has been uploaded

Step 2. Copy the file into one of the buckets earlier created

gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]


==================================================
Task 3: Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
==================================================

A. Append the environment variable to a file

Step 1. Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class

mkdir infraclass


Step 2. Create a file called config in the infraclass directory

touch infraclass/config


Step 3. Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file

echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config


Step 4. Create a second environment variable for your Project ID

INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]


Step 5. Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file

echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config


Step 6. Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set

source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID


Step 7. Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID



B. Modify the bash profile and create persistence

Step 1. Edit the shell profile with the following command

nano .profile


Step 2. Add the following line to the end of the file

source infraclass/config

Save, Close and re-open Cloud shell to cycle the Vm


Step 3. Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID


You should now see the expected value that you set in the config file
